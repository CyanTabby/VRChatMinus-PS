# VRChatMinus PS script
This is a PowerShell script based on the concept of the original [VRChatMinus](https://github.com/Koyoinu/VRChat-Minus).
### What's the difference?
This version:
* Doesn't require you to force close and restart Steam every time you launch VRChat (due to Steam thinking the game is still running)
* Accepts launch options and passes them through to VRChat
* Allegedly doesn't break video players with certain links

# Installation
1. Download the files [here](https://github.com/CyanTabby/VRChatMinus-PS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or by clicking the green `<> Code` button then `Download ZIP`
2. Extract `VRChatMinus-PS-main.zip`
3. Allow local PowerShell scripts to run without being signed. You can find this in Windows settings by searching for "scripts"

# Usage
1. **Only required first time:** Right click on `VRChatMinus-PS.ps1` and select `Run with PowerShell` to test the script and generate a shortcut
2. **Optional:** Modify or add your preferred VRChat launch options in `VRChatMinus-PS.ps1` with any text editor
