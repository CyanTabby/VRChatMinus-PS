# VRChatMinus PS script
This is a PowerShell script based on the concept of the original [VRChatMinus](https://github.com/Koyoinu/VRChat-Minus).
### What's the difference?
This version:
* Doesn't require you to force close and restart Steam every time you launch VRChat (due to Steam thinking the game is still running)
* Accepts launch options and passes them through to VRChat
* Allegedly doesn't break video players with certain links
